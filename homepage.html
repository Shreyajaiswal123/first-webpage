                    Karnataka state. The center of India's high-tech industry, the city is
                    also known for its parks and nightlife. By Cubbon Park, Vidhana Soudha
                    is a Neo-Dravidian legislative building. Former royal residences
                    include 19th-century Bangalore Palace, modeled after England’s Windsor
                    Castle, and Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace, an 18th-century teak
                    structure</p>
